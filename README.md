# Base64 Codec

<a href="README.md">English</a> | <a href="README.zh-TW.md">繁體中文</a>

This project is an implementation of Base64 codec in C++.  
Due to the diversity of Base64 implementations in multiple programming languages,   
the practical value of this project is relatively low.  
The main purpose is to practice and get more familiar with C++ programming.
